# Sorting Algo Visualiser Spec

Here's a spec for what I want to make that's a bit more fleshed out and the order I'll make it in. It will help me with implementation having somthing planned out to follow.

I want to create a visually engaging and informative page that demonstrates different sorting algorithms, with the following elements and features for the user experience:

### User Interface Design

1. **Header**:

   - Title: "Sorting Algorithms visualiser"
   - Brief Description: An introductory paragraph explaining what sorting algorithms are and why they are important.

2. **Control Panel**: COMPLETE

   ✅ - **Algorithm Selector**: A dropdown menu or buttons allowing users to select different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).

   ✅ - **Array Size Slider**: A slider to adjust the size of the array to be sorted, allowing users to see how the algorithms handle different amounts of data.

   ✅ - **Speed Control**: A slider or buttons to control the speed of the visualisation, so users can slow down or speed up the sorting process.

   ✅ - **Generate New Array Button**: A button to generate a new random array to be sorted.

   ✅ - **Start Button**: A button to start sorting visualisation.

3. **visualisation Area**: COMPLETE

   ✅ - **Bars or Elements**: A series of bars or other visual elements representing the array to be sorted. Each element's height (or size) corresponds to its value.

   ✅ - **Color Coding**: Use different colors to indicate the current state of the elements. For example:
   -- Normal state (e.g., blue)
   -- Elements being compared (e.g., red)

   ✅ - **Animation**: Smooth transitions to show the swapping, shifting, or merging of elements. This helps users visually track the changes happening in the array.

4. **Algorithm Explanation Panel**:

   - Text area or modal that explains the steps of the selected algorithm in plain language.

5. **Statistics Panel**:

   - **Operations Counter**: Displays the number of comparisons and swaps performed.
   - **Time Elapsed**: Shows the time taken to sort the array.

6. **Responsive Design**: COMPLETE

   ✅ - Ensure the visualiser is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### User Experience Flow

1. **Landing on the Page**:

   - Users are greeted with a brief introduction to sorting algorithms and the purpose of the visualiser.
   - Clear instructions on how to use the control panel to select an algorithm, adjust settings, and start the visualisation.

2. **Selecting an Algorithm and Configuring Settings**: COMPLETE

   ✅ - Users choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown or buttons.

   ✅ - They adjust the array size and visualisation speed using the sliders.

   ✅ - They generate a new array and start the visualisation.

3. **Watching the visualisation**:

   ✅ - Users watch as the array elements are sorted in real-time.

   ✅ - They observe the color changes and animations to understand the sorting process.

4. **Learning and Comparing**:
   - Users can read the explanation panel to understand how the selected algorithm works.
   - They can reset and select different algorithms to compare their performance and behavior.
   - They can see the statistics update in real-time, providing insights into the efficiency of each algorithm.

By focusing on these design elements and user experience flows, I can create an engaging and educational sorting algorithm visualiser that helps users understand and compare different sorting methods effectively.
